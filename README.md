# MathRace
Game built in Unity engine to allow 1st and 2nd graders practice math problems while driving a kart around a map.
This game used the Unity engine as well as some C+ background for development.  This was developed in my Software engineering class in college
in the Spring of 2020.

This was a colaborative project with 3 other classmates over the course of the semester using the AGILE development method.
